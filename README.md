## 📚 About
This is my personal python project for extracting audio files from video. It can extract audio from a mp4 (video file) in mp3 format. In fact, I've made it so that it can do so for all music in a given directory also within the sub directories. A fun project to do! This project is something that I did on my free time.✅
